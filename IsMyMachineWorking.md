You are new to the ST world, how do you determine if the new machine works?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* before even getting your ST, you should know that the ST is as brittle as glass.  
Ask the seller to put it in 5 layers of bubble wrap, put that in a box.  
but that box into 3 more layers of bubble wrap and put that box into a second box.  
Ask to get pictures of the packaging process. Offer to pay $5 more for this.  
* check the outside if it looks fine. no rust? no noise inside when turning upside down?
* switching on: the power led on lower left corner should come on, if not, the LED is broken or the power supply has an issue.
* The methods for obtaining a picture from the ST are the original monitor (ST has 2 modes, monochrome and color, which use incompatible signals, so you need both).  
Color can be connected to TV with analog input (SCART)  
Mono can be connected to any VGA display via available adaptors. Some older VGA monitors can directly support color resolutions (look for 15kHz). 
Here is a list https://15khz.net/
* after switching on, the screen should show a white image. If you see regular patterns, your RAM has problems. (what happens if the ROM is bad?)  
please let it run at least 1 minute. Normally the desktop should appear with a menu on top. If nothing happens, then there is a problem.
* no screen/TV? Try just connecting audio.  
If you press a key, a key click must be heard.  
On STE you can connect an amp to the cinch connectors. If you hear a click, then the OS is running machine should be OK.
* Floppy test: insert floppy, remove floppy, look at the hole on the underside and move it 1/4 turn, memorize position, insert floppy, remove floppy, has the hole moved? If not: floppy problem.
* Mouse cursor does not move (no mouse, broken connector): use ALT key with the cursor keys.  
ALT+insert is left click. ALT+clrhome is right click. Add SHIFT for slow move.

I guess many more simple tests can be added here...
