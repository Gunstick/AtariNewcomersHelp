Now that your ST is working...

* The maximum RAM size on a standard ST is 4mb (TT/falcon: 14MB and more).  
On old TOS, size can only be determined with a program like the [sysinfo tool](http://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-st-sysinfo_34223.html)
* If your ST comes with an USB port (a Gotek device) or SD card reader (HxC floppy,CosmosEx) instead of floppy, you can put files on the card/stick ending in .MSA or .ST, that should work. 
There are also external harddisk devices using SD cards, like UltraSatan.
* External drive as internal: drive swap is possible but requires soldering inside the machine.  
So one should decide wisely if drive A (internal) or B (external) should be the SD card/USB stick.  
Most people prefer not using an external drive and use the internal with an USB/SD adapter.
* The TOS version can be determined with the desktop info. (needs link to various screenshots) or with the [sysinfo tool](http://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-st-sysinfo_34223.html)
* All software can be downloaded [here] http://www.atarimania.com/atari-st-tt-falcon.html
* It is not easy to copy a downloaded image on a floppy, that's why an SD card is preferable. (any good link here?)
* To transfer simple data, you can format a floppy on ST (but needs a recent TOS) which can then be read/write from windows.  
Or format with cmd: `FORMAT A: /T:80 /N:9 /u`  
This will not work for most of the games.
